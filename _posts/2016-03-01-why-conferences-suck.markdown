I'm not a big fan of conferences in general. Conference should be a great place to learn about the tools you work with
and to get introductions to new tools/technologies/...

But I really think all conferences suck. And not because they are not organised well, have high prices. 

We have conference that allow people to speak about certain topics, but those talks have multiple problems:

First of all, talks are to general or to specific. I'm aware that you can't know each member of the audience in advance and
tailor your talk specific on each member of it. But at least 50% of the audience won't be happy.

Most talks are given about using a technology/method/... for solving a problem the speaker encountered for a very
specific problem. Bounded to the company he/she works for, the people he/she works with, the available tools/knowlegde/...

Too be able to reach a bigger audience the talk is generalised by stripping the "situation" of specifics. And that is 
what really sucks. Because a specific solutions is presented for a "general" problem.

Secondly, talks are focused ons using the latest version of software, the alpha-beta-major-wip-stealth-fucking-release-candidate 
flavor of the tool/library/... But for developers who really work for a living those versions aren't available. Due to
constraints of the company, due to dependencies, ...

Personally I work on multiple projects, some of them started 4 years ago, and if I have learned 1 thing, then it is that
clients won't pay for upgrading to new versions of PHP, because they just don't care. And please don't come with bullshit 
about security-updates, ... because they really don't care. Just ask your own hosting-provider what the oldest PHP-version
is they have in production.

And I am aware of the fact that everybody should upgrade but the truth is that nobody wants to pay for it, and I don't
think there are many developers around that would upgrade a project in their spare time.
